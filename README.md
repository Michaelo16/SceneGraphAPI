# Scene Graph API
an API for desiging graphical scenes utilizing Open GL through JOGL

## Description 
--
This is a Graphics library I created which implements a Scene Graph. It offers tools to be able to design complex Scenes utilizing 
simple primitive shapes or custom polygonal meshes. The Scene graph API offers utility to setting up the camera, creating lighting, 
adding and designing hierarchical objects, and giving them textures. There are a couple test scenes that just display use of the main
features. The challenge of the assignment was creating a design, and it was a great learning experience for creating large scale, 
inter-connected software. 

## Requirements
Java JDK 17, I created the project in Eclipse

## Dependencies
This project utilizes JOGL, for which an installation guide can be found here: https://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the src folder into a new project
3. download the required libraries and add them to the project buildpath
4 Navigate to the Scenes package and run either the Simple3DScene or SnowmanScene. jar files.
